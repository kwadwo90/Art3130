           My name is Kojo Asare.I am passionate about photography and always delighted to be behind the camera.I am so grateful for each and every experience that life had to offer me and humbled to part of each and every photo session. Each day is a learning  path for me as a document memorable events in people's life.It is an amazing feeling to be part of people's stories. </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 6%"; spellcheck="true"> I am an Accounting major student and my passion for photography brought me to the Arts department. I took Intro to Photography and that is where it all started. Developing my creative abilities  was very breathe taking. I am passionate about capturing beautiful landscapes and candid moments of people. I have met a lot of people on this Photography journey and is amazing. Experiencing two different cultures gives me a  different perspective in creating my art. The artist that inspires me most is Gregory Crewdson. I love his level his level of detail and how he tries to capture candid moments in his society. For now phottography is a hobby for me but I have started making money of it. I hope to make it full time career someday
